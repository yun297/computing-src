    "2. **Dynamic Allocation**: The number of recursive calls and the depth of recursion are typically not known in advance. A stack allows for dynamic allocation of memory for each call, growing and shrinking as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Order**: The stack's LIFO nature matches the execution order of recursive calls. When a recursive call is made, the current state is pushed onto the stack. When returning from a call, the most recent state is popped from the stack, ensuring that the program resumes execution in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automatic Cleanup**: When a function returns, the stack automatically discards the variables used by that instance of the function, simplifying memory management and preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Nested Calls Management**: Storing variables on a stack allows the program to manage nested calls efficiently. Each function call's context (including parameters, local variables, and return address) is stored on the stack, enabling the program to return to the correct state after each recursive call.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **recursive routine** in a program is a function or procedure that calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursion divides a problem into smaller subproblems of the same type and solves each subproblem independently. The base case(s) stops the recursion by providing a direct solution without further recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a data structure that follows a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order, meaning the last element pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off. In the context of recursive routines, a stack is used to store information about each function call, such as the function's parameters, local variables, and the return address. This allows the program to resume execution correctly after returning from a recursive call.\n",

    "### Abstract Data Type (ADT) for Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "An Abstract Data Type (ADT) consists of both data type and associated operations. A linked list ADT has the following operations defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create (x)**  \n",
    "   Creates an empty linked list `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert (x, item, p)**  \n",
    "   Inserts a new value, `item`, into linked list `x` so that it is at position `p` in the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Delete (x, p)**  \n",
    "   Deletes the item at position `p` in the linked list `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Read (x, p)**  \n",
    "   Returns the item at position `p` in the linked list `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Length (x)**  \n",
    "   Returns the number of items in the linked list `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **IsEmptyList (x)**  \n",
    "   Returns `true` if linked list `x` is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked list is implemented by the use of a collection of nodes that have two parts:\n",
    "- The item data\n",
    "- A pointer to the next item in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a `Start` pointer which points to the first item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw diagrams to show the two different situations that can arise when the \"Insert\" operation specified above is implemented.\n",
    "2. Write an algorithm that could be used to implement the \"Insert\" operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `nodes_and_liked_list.py file` for the implementation of the linked list ADT.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Show how to implement the following operations for a stack ADT using the list ADT operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create new stack;\n",
    "2. Add item on top of stack;\n",
    "3. Delete item from top of stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) A dictionary ADT is used to store a key value and a definition of that key value. Specify three operations for a dictionary ADT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Operations for a Dictionary ADT\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary ADT is used to store key-value pairs where each key is associated with a corresponding value. Here are three essential operations for a dictionary ADT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insert (key, value)**  \n",
    "   Adds a key-value pair to the dictionary. If the key already exists, its value is updated with the new value.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   FUNCTION Insert(dictionary, key, value)\n",
    "       // Code to add or update the key-value pair in the dictionary\n",
    "   ENDFUNCTION\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delete (key)**  \n",
    "   Removes the key-value pair associated with the specified key from the dictionary.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   FUNCTION Delete(dictionary, key)\n",
    "       // Code to remove the key-value pair from the dictionary\n",
    "   ENDFUNCTION\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lookup (key)**  \n",
    "   Retrieves the value associated with the specified key. If the key does not exist, it returns a suitable error or null value.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   FUNCTION Lookup(dictionary, key)\n",
    "       // Code to retrieve the value associated with the key\n",
    "   ENDFUNCTION\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) State two advantages of using ADTs in program development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Advantages of Using ADTs in Program Development\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction**  \n",
    "   ADTs provide a clear separation between the implementation and the interface. This means that the details of how the data structure is implemented are hidden from the user, who interacts with the data structure only through well-defined operations. This abstraction simplifies the development process, as developers can focus on high-level design without worrying about implementation details. It also makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reusability and Modularity**  \n",
    "   ADTs allow for the creation of modular and reusable code components. Since the operations of an ADT are defined independently of their implementation, the same ADT can be reused in different programs and projects without modification. This modularity enhances productivity and reduces redundancy, as developers can leverage existing ADT implementations to solve new problems, ensuring consistency and reliability in their applications."
